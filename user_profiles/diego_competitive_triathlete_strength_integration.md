# User Profile: Diego (Competitive triathlete integrating strength)

## Login (dev)

- Email: `diego.tri@axis.test`
- Password: `axis-demo-diego`
- Notes: prefers **metric** units; wants coach visibility into adaptations.

## Snapshot

- Age: 27
- Training identity: competitive triathlete (Olympic → 70.3)
- Primary goal: improve bike power and durability without losing run speed
- Secondary goal: stay injury-free through high-volume blocks
- Coaching: coach-led (used TrainingPeaks historically)
- Devices/integrations: Garmin/Wahoo + Strava; structured workouts; HRV/sleep tracking

## Background & current behavior

- High compliance when the plan is clear; expects accountability and oversight.
- Comfortable with metrics (power zones, HR, pace) and wants plan-vs-actual review.
- Travels for work; compliance failures often come from schedule disruption.

## Constraints

- Time: 8–12 hours/week in-season, 12–16 in build phases.
- Travel: 1–2 weeks/month with limited equipment.
- Fatigue: large swings; needs readiness-aware adjustment without losing overall progression.

## Training preferences

- Endurance: 2 key bike sessions + 1 long ride + 2–3 runs + 2–3 swims/week.
- Strength:
  - off-season: 2×/week heavier full-body
  - in-season: 1×/week maintenance + mobility
- Wants: the system to adapt sessions but keep the macro plan intact.

## What Diego needs from AXIS

- A first-class adaptation log that preserves coach trust:
  - what changed, why, and how it impacts the week’s objectives
- Compliance insights at the “plan structure” level:
  - weekday patterns, travel effects, long-session completion rates
- Ability to differentiate reasons:
  - low readiness vs schedule conflict vs illness

## Key success metrics (for Diego)

- Keystone execution rate (bike power + run quality sessions)
- Weekly endurance volume and intensity distribution
- Strength maintenance consistency (especially during race season)
- Coach-facing compliance/adaptation summaries (30/90 days)

## Likely failure modes

- Over-adapting downward during travel → fitness stalls.
- Readiness gaming on hard days when motivation dips.
- Coach distrust if adaptations are not transparent.

## AXIS coaching posture that works

- Make adaptations explicit and reversible (“undo”) with clear reasoning.
- Use gentle guardrails for keystones (confirmation + reason to skip).
- Provide coach-ready summaries:
  - “Last 30 days: 2 trims (fatigue), 3 swaps (travel), 1 skip (illness).”
