# User Profile: Priya (Marathoner adding strength for durability)

## Login (dev)

- Password: `axis-demo-priya`
- Notes: prefers **metric** units; running workouts are non-negotiable keystones.

## Snapshot

- Age: 35
- Training identity: endurance athlete (running)
- Primary goal: PR marathon in ~16 weeks
- Secondary goal: reduce injury risk (calf/Achilles history), improve running economy
- Coaching: sometimes follows a marathon plan; open to coach review
- Devices/integrations: Garmin + Strava; tracks pace, HR, mileage

## Background & current behavior

- Runs 5–6 days/week; consistent but historically under-strength-trained.
- Believes strength helps but worries about soreness ruining quality run days.
- Will do strength if it is clearly “runner-specific,” time-efficient, and scheduled intelligently.

## Constraints

- Time: weekday runs 45–70 min; strength must be 25–40 min.
- Recovery: can tolerate volume but sensitive to heavy eccentric soreness.
- Equipment: gym 1–2×/week; otherwise bodyweight/bands.

## Training preferences

- Running:
  - 1 long run/week
  - 1 quality session/week (tempo/intervals)
  - easy mileage otherwise
- Strength:
  - 2×/week (glutes/hamstrings/calves/core)
  - prefers moderate loads, controlled tempo, minimal DOMS
- Wants: strength sessions placed away from key run workouts.

## What Priya needs from AXIS

- Clear “keystone protection” logic:
  - never compromise the long run or quality run without explicit rationale
- Strength plans that map to running needs:
  - calf/ankle stiffness work, posterior chain, trunk stiffness
- Compliance insights that identify friction:
  - “Strength on Wednesday has a 40% completion rate → move to Monday/Friday.”

## Key success metrics (for Priya)

- Weekly mileage consistency and long-run completion
- Quality run execution (pace/HR trend)
- Strength consistency (2 sessions/week hit rate)
- Injury risk indicators (missed runs due to soreness/pain)

## Likely failure modes

- Drops strength when mileage peaks.
- Overdoes strength intensity → DOMS → sabotages speed work.
- Misses sessions due to time and feels guilty → spirals.

## AXIS coaching posture that works

- Keep strength minimal, targeted, and periodized with the run plan.
- Treat strength compliance as a habit to build:
  - adaptive goal + streaks + “minimum viable lift” options.
- Explain “why” behind scheduling and adaptations in simple terms.
