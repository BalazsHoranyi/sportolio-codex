# User Profile: Evan (Powerlifter, minimal cardio for health)

## Login (dev)

- Email: `evan.powerlifter@axis.test`
- Password: `axis-demo-evan`
- Notes: prefers **imperial** units; wants minimal endurance surfaces.

## Snapshot

- Age: 32
- Training identity: powerlifter first
- Primary goal: increase S/B/D total while keeping resting HR/BP in a healthy range
- Secondary goal: stay “athletic enough” for hiking/playing sports without gasping
- Coaching: self-coached (occasionally buys a block template online)
- Devices/integrations: none required; may import occasional Apple Watch/Strava cardio

## Background & current behavior

- 6+ years lifting; has dialed-in strength technique and cares about highly repeatable sessions.
- Historically avoids cardio because it “kills leg day” and feels like wasted time.
- Will comply with cardio if it is:
  - short, low impact, clearly justified, and
  - explicitly not allowed to interfere with heavy lower-body training.

## Constraints

- Time: 60–75 min for lifting, 20–30 min for cardio (max) 1–2×/week.
- Equipment: full gym access; prefers bike/rower over running (knee discomfort).
- Recovery: sleeps 6–7 hours; stress moderate; tends to push intensity even when tired.

## Training preferences

- Strength: 4 days/week (2 upper, 2 lower), top set + back-offs, accessories for weak points.
- Conditioning: 1–2 “health” sessions/week:
  - Zone 2 bike/row (20–30 min) or
  - very short intervals only if explicitly “non-interfering.”
- Hates: long steady runs; high soreness legs before squat/deadlift days.

## What Evan needs from AXIS

- Strength logging that is fast and “lifting-app quality” (sets, RPE, 1RM estimates, PRs).
- Clear interference guardrails:
  - cardio placement rules relative to squat/deadlift days
  - warnings when endurance dose risks degrading strength performance
- A compliance view that shows:
  - when cardio was skipped (accountability), and
  - when the system adapted the plan to protect main lifts (trust).

## Key success metrics (for Evan)

- Squat/bench/deadlift e1RM trend and weekly tonnage
- Hard set counts by movement pattern
- Soreness/fatigue trend vs lower-body performance
- “Health minimums” hit rate (cardio minutes/week + steps)

## Likely failure modes

- Skips cardio repeatedly → health goal stalls.
- Does extra “ego sets” → accumulates fatigue and blames the plan.
- If the app silently adapts too much, he assumes it is “making excuses.”

## AXIS coaching posture that works

- Use “minimum effective dose” language and show tradeoffs.
- Keep accountability visible (“you skipped the health session”), but offer a low-friction recovery path:
  - swap to low-impact bike, reduce duration, or shift day.
- Provide coach-like insights:
  - “Tuesdays are consistently heavy + time constrained → move cardio to Thursday after upper body.”
