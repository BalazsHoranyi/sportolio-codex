# User Profile: Nora (Masters endurance athlete, longevity + strength)

## Login (dev)

- Email: `nora.masters@axis.test`
- Password: `axis-demo-nora`
- Notes: prefers **metric** units; wants recovery-aware plans and simple UI.

## Snapshot

- Age: 52
- Training identity: long-time endurance enthusiast (cycling + hiking; occasional charity rides)
- Primary goal: longevity (bone density, muscle retention, metabolic health)
- Secondary goal: keep doing long rides without back/hip pain
- Coaching: none; may consult a PT periodically
- Devices/integrations: Apple Watch + Apple Health; sometimes Strava

## Background & current behavior

- Consistent with endurance (social rides and weekend volume).
- Strength has been intermittent; intimidation + soreness + uncertainty about what to do.
- Highly sensitive to poor sleep and work stress; needs training that respects recovery.

## Constraints

- Time: 45–60 min most weekdays; long ride on weekend.
- Recovery: sleep can be inconsistent; needs low-variance training stress.
- Equipment: gym access, but prefers machines/dumbbells; wants clear movement guidance.

## Training preferences

- Endurance: 3–4 rides/week, mostly easy; 1 longer ride.
- Strength: 2×/week, joint-friendly:
  - hinge/squat patterns, pushing/pulling, carries, core
  - emphasis on progressive overload without chasing maximal intensity
- Wants: reassurance that strength won’t “wreck” the rest of the week.

## What Nora needs from AXIS

- A low-friction strength plan that feels safe and confidence-building.
- Readiness-aware adaptations that remain transparent:
  - “we reduced intensity today because sleep was poor”
- Compliance insights that help redesign the week:
  - “Mondays are often time-constrained → shorten Monday strength session.”

## Key success metrics (for Nora)

- Weekly strength consistency (2 sessions/week)
- Endurance minutes/week without pain flare-ups
- Sleep/stress correlations with training tolerance
- Trend: fewer weeks derailed by soreness or fatigue

## Likely failure modes

- Over-soreness from strength → skips next session → loses confidence.
- Avoids progressive overload due to fear of injury.
- Gets discouraged by “red marks” if the system feels judgmental.

## AXIS coaching posture that works

- Emphasize sustainability and recovery; keep feedback non-punitive.
- Provide “minimum dose” alternatives on low-readiness days (machines, lighter loads).
- Celebrate milestones (streaks, consistency improvements) more than perfection.
