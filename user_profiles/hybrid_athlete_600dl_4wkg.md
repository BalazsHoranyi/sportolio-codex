## Snapshot

- Age: 31
- Training identity: true hybrid — strength and endurance are both performance priorities
- Primary goals:
  - deadlift **600+ lb** (272+ kg) while staying healthy
  - cycling FTP **4.0 W/kg** (with stable bodyweight)
- Secondary goals: durable running base (optional), strong work capacity, minimal injury downtime
- Coaching: self-coached but “coachable”; wants high-quality plan logic and transparency
- Devices/integrations: Wahoo/Garmin + Strava; expects clean structured workout handling

## Background & current behavior

- Has already reached “advanced” in both domains but tends to yo-yo focus:
  - heavy strength blocks hurt endurance; endurance pushes stall strength.
- Highly motivated and data-literate; will follow a plan if the rationale is good.
- Tracks readiness and tends to push through fatigue unless explicitly shown the cost.

## Constraints

- Time: 8–12 hours/week typical; 12–16 hours in a build phase
- Schedule: weekdays are structured; weekends available for long endurance
- Recovery: sleep varies; can tolerate high workload if intensity distribution is managed
- Equipment: full gym + bike trainer

## Training preferences

- Strength:
  - 3–4 days/week
  - heavy hinge emphasis (deadlift focus), but wants back/hamstring management to avoid chronic tightness
  - cares about progression clarity (top set, back-offs, volume targets)
- Endurance:
  - 3–5 sessions/week depending on phase
  - wants 1–2 key intensity sessions + 1 longer aerobic session
  - dislikes “junk intensity” and wants clear zone targets

## What “Hybrid Athlete” needs from AXIS

- A plan that explicitly manages **interference**:
  - strength intensity vs key endurance days
  - fatigue accounting so heavy lower-body work doesn’t destroy key bike sessions
- Clear “keystone” definitions on both sides:
  - key strength session(s) and key bike session(s) that should be protected
- Transparent adaptation logging:
  - if intensity is reduced or sessions are swapped, they want to know exactly why and how the weekly goal is preserved
- Compliance coaching that doesn’t get too “soft”:
  - still wants accountability signals (red/yellow/green), not silent accommodation

## Key success metrics (for this user)

- Strength:
  - deadlift e1RM + top-set quality
  - weekly hard sets (hinge, squat pattern, posterior chain accessories)
- Endurance:
  - FTP trend (absolute W and W/kg)
  - time in zone + completion rate for key intervals
  - long-ride consistency
- System-level:
  - compliance to keystone sessions
  - number + reasons of plan adaptations (readiness vs schedule vs overreach)

## Likely failure modes

- Overreaches by stacking intensity (heavy pulls + hard intervals) → readiness crater → forced deload.
- “Readiness gaming” when motivation dips on endurance days (inputs drift from reality).
- Chooses the more enjoyable domain each week and lets the other decay.

## AXIS coaching posture that works

- Treat them like a serious athlete:
  - be explicit about tradeoffs and stimulus priorities
  - propose phase-based focus (e.g., strength bias vs endurance bias) while maintaining the other
- Use guardrails:
  - prompt before stacking two keystone sessions too close
  - suggest swaps that preserve stimulus without hiding the deviation
- Give a clear weekly objective summary:
  - “This week’s win conditions: hit heavy hinge + hit FTP intervals + long aerobic ride.”
