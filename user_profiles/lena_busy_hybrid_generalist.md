- Notes: prefers **metric** units; values streaks and simple goals.

## Snapshot

- Age: 29
- Training identity: “I want to be fit” (not sport-specific)
- Primary goal: sustainable routine (strength + some running) without burnout
- Secondary goal: body composition + energy + mood
- Coaching: none; wants the app to feel like a supportive coach
- Devices/integrations: Apple Watch; occasional Strava

## Background & current behavior

- Has started/quit programs multiple times; biggest enemy is schedule volatility.
- Will do hard work when momentum is high; derails after 1–2 missed sessions.
- Responds well to positive reinforcement and “small wins.”

## Constraints

- Time: 30–45 min on weekdays; longer on weekends (sometimes).
- Life: job + family responsibilities; workouts often happen in unpredictable windows.
- Equipment: home setup (adjustable dumbbells + bands) + occasional gym.

## Training preferences

- Strength: 2–3×/week full-body, simple movements, low cognitive load.
- Endurance: 2×/week run/walk or short bike; wants “feel good” not suffering.
- Wants: flexibility to swap days without feeling like she “failed.”

## What Lena needs from AXIS

- A plan that adapts to real life while still preserving momentum.
- Compliance coaching framed as encouragement:
  - adaptive weekly goals (“let’s hit 5 of 6 sessions”)
  - streaks/milestones that reward consistency
- Clear categorization of why sessions changed:
  - schedule conflict vs low readiness vs motivation

## Key success metrics (for Lena)

- Weekly goal attainment (%)
- Keystone sessions completed (simple definition)
- Streak length (weeks meeting goal)
- “Time on feet” or minutes trained/week (not perfection)

## Likely failure modes

- “All-or-nothing” thinking after a missed day.
- Readiness gaming to avoid hard work when stressed.
- Getting overwhelmed by too many metrics or too much plan complexity.

## AXIS coaching posture that works

- Set realistic compliance goals and raise them gradually.
- Offer “good/better/best” options for days with limited time.
- Gently call out repeated under-training patterns:
  - “We’ve trimmed 4 sessions in 2 weeks—should we adjust the baseline plan?”
